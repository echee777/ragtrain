( another type of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions ; instead, it used materials such as hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur ). it is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars being produced but that these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. the development of glycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials spontaneously accumulating in the “ primeval soup. ” a later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and hydrogen and generated free oxygen. over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated, but not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a “ rust ” layer in the sediment, permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers. living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve. when the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. 7. 7 regulation of cellular respiration by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe how feedback inhibition would affect the production of an intermediate or product in a pathway • identify the mechanism that controls the rate of the transport of electrons through the electron transport chain cellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of atp. the cell also must generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of

first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium, the third corresponds to plasma membrane of the green alga, and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor. in other lineages that involved secondary endosymbiosis, only three membranes can be identified around plastids. this is currently interpreted as a sequential loss of a membrane during the course of evolution. the process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes. secondary plastids are also found in the excavates and the chromalveolates. in the excavates, secondary endosymbiosis of green algae led to euglenid protists, while in the chromalveolates, secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to the evolution of plastids in dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and stramenopiles. 23. 2 characteristics of protists by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe the cell structure characteristics of protists • describe the metabolic diversity of protists • describe the life cycle diversity of protists there are over 100, 000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist. since many protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species - specific, there is a huge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of their hosts. because the name " protist " serves as a catchall term for eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all protists. on the other hand, familiar characteristics of plants and animals are foreshadowed in various protists. cell structure the cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. multicellular plants, animals, and fungi are embedded among the protists in eukaryotic phylogeny. in most plants and animals and some fungi, complexity arises out of multicellularity, tissue specialization, and subsequent interaction because of these features. although a rudimentary form of multicellularity exists among some of the organisms labelled

Genetic maps represent the arrangement of genes on a chromosome. While there can be variations between individuals due to genetic diversity, the overall genetic maps within a species are similar because they are based on the same set of genes and genetic markers. This similarity allows for the comparison of genetic information and the study of genetic variation within a species.

encountered. the arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code. there are sixteen " blocks " of codons, each specified by the first and second nucleotides of the codons within the block, e. g., the " ac * " block that corresponds to the amino acid threonine ( thr ). some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half, in which the codon ends with u or c, and a purine half, in which the codon ends with a or g. some amino acids get a whole block of four codons, like alanine ( ala ), threonine ( thr ) and proline ( pro ). some get the pyrimidine half of their block, like histidine ( his ) and asparagine ( asn ). others get the purine half of their block, like glutamate ( glu ) and lysine ( lys ). note that some amino acids get a block and a half - block for a total of six codons. the specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called " degeneracy. " degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. for example, aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ), which occupy the ga * block, are both negatively charged. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single - nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. access for free at openstax. org. 15. 1 • the genetic code the genetic code is nearly universal. with a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering

##phological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were once thought to be closely related. however, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. these two clades now make up the protostomes. another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely new phylum of worm called acoelomorpha. these acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum platyhelminthes because of their similar “ flatworm ” morphology. however, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. more recent research into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to deuterostomes. the placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data, their true phylogeny will be determined. another example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal kingdom. ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the cnidaria, and the sponges ( porifera ) were placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals. the presence of nerve and muscle cells in both the ctenophores and the cnidaria and their absence in the porifera strengthened this view of the relationships among simple animal forms. however, recent molecular analysis has shown that many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are absent from the ctenophore genome. the muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the mesoglea. the mitochondrial genome of the ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial genomes. these features plus the absence of hox genes from the ctenophores have been used to argue that the ctenophores should be considered basal or as a sister group of the porifera, and that

world via free - living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation ( conversion of n2 ). cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present ; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to “ fix ” nitrogen. rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes ( such as peas, beans, and peanuts ) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. ( for example, gardeners often grow peas both for their produce and to naturally add nitrogen to the soil. this practice goes back to ancient times, even if the science has only been recently understood. ) free - living bacteria, such as azotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers. organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. as shown in figure 46. 17, the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria. this process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems : ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. first, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium 1359 1360 chapter 46 • ecosystems ( nh4 + ) by certain bacteria and fungi. second, the ammonium is converted to nitrites ( no2− ) by nitrifying bacteria, such as nitrosomonas, through nitrification. subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates ( no3− ) by similar organisms. third, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as pseudomonas and clostridium, convert the nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing it to reenter the atmosphere. visual connection figure 46. 17 nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogen - fixing bacteria. this nitrogen and nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need.

determine a person ’ s genotype from the genotype of their offspring. for example, if neither parent has the disorder but their child does, they must be heterozygous. two individuals on the pedigree have an unaffected phenotype but unknown genotype. because they do not have the disorder, they must have at least one normal allele, so their genotype gets the “ a? ” designation. what are the genotypes of the individuals labeled 1, 2, and 3? alternatives to dominance and recessiveness mendel ’ s experiments with pea plants suggested that : ( 1 ) two “ units ” or alleles exist for every gene ; ( 2 ) alleles maintain their integrity in each generation ( no blending ) ; and ( 3 ) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden and makes no contribution to the phenotype. therefore, recessive alleles can be “ carried ” and not expressed by individuals. such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as “ carriers. ” further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of mendelian genetics still hold true. in the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of mendelism. if mendel had chosen an experimental system that exhibited these genetic complexities, it ’ s possible that he would not have understood what his results meant. incomplete dominance mendel ’ s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents ’ traits. however, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate between the two parents. for example, in the snapdragon, antirrhinum majus ( figure 12. 7 ), a cross between a homozygous parent with white flowers ( cwcw ) and a homozygous parent with red flowers ( crcr ) will produce offspring with pink flowers ( crcw ). ( note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness. ) this pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype

##phological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were once thought to be closely related. however, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. these two clades now make up the protostomes. another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely new phylum of worm called acoelomorpha. these acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum platyhelminthes because of their similar “ flatworm ” morphology. however, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. more recent research into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to deuterostomes. the placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data, their true phylogeny will be determined. another example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal kingdom. ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the cnidaria, and the sponges ( porifera ) were placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals. the presence of nerve and muscle cells in both the ctenophores and the cnidaria and their absence in the porifera strengthened this view of the relationships among simple animal forms. however, recent molecular analysis has shown that many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are absent from the ctenophore genome. the muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the mesoglea. the mitochondrial genome of the ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial genomes. these features plus the absence of hox genes from the ctenophores have been used to argue that the ctenophores should be considered basal or as a sister group of the porifera, and that

adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life - history patterns the logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of realworld population dynamics. implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. the carrying capacity varies annually : for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. in many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. they engage in interspecific competition : that is, they share the environment with other species competing for the same resources. these factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow. nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. these are grouped into density - dependent factors, in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density - independent factors, which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density. note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset. conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation. density - dependent regulation most density - dependent factors are biological in nature ( biotic ), and include predation, inter - and intraspecific competition, accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. for example, during intra - and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower, reducing their population ’ s rate of growth. in addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source. an example of density - dependent regulation is shown in figure 45. 11 with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal roundworm ( ascaris lumbricoides ), a parasite of humans and other mammals. 3 denser populations of the parasite exhibited lower fecundity : they contained fewer eggs. one possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations ( due to limited resources ) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. this hypothesis was tested and disproved in

( credit : modification of work by mariana ruiz villareal ) in preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the plasma membrane's inward - facing surface becomes coated with the protein clathrin, which stabilizes this membrane's section. the membrane's coated portion then extends from the cell's body and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for breaking down the material in the newly formed compartment ( endosome ). when accessible nutrients from the vesicular contents'degradation have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid.

of new mitochondria. mitochondria divide independently by a process that resembles binary fission in prokaryotes. mitochondria arise only from previous mitochondria ; they are not formed from scratch ( de novo ) by the eukaryotic cell. mitochondria may fuse together ; and they may be moved around inside the cell by interactions with the cytoskeleton. they reproduce within their enclosing cell and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell divides or two cells fuse. therefore, although these organelles are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell, they still reproduce as if they were independent organisms within the cell. however, their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and division of the cell. these features all support the theory that mitochondria were once free - living prokaryotes. some living eukaryotes are anaerobic and cannot survive in the presence of too much oxygen. however, a few appear to lack organelles that could be recognized as mitochondria. in the 1970s and on into the early 1990s, many biologists suggested that access for free at openstax. org. 23. 1 • eukaryotic origins some of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrioncontaining eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred. later findings suggest that reduced organelles are found in most, if not all, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that virtually all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial origin. in addition to the aerobic generation of atp, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions. one of these functions is to generate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes. such functions are often associated with the reduced mitochondrion - derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes. the protist monocercomonoides, an inhabitant of vertebrate digestive tracts, appears to be an exception ; it has no mitochondria and its genome contains neither genes derived from mitochondria nor nuclear genes related to mitochondrial maintenance. however, it is related to other protists with reduced mitochondria and probably represents an end - point in mitochondrial reduction. although most biologists

foundation ) a unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of an eversible proboscis enclosed in a pocket called a rhynchocoel ( not part of the animal's actual coelom ). the proboscis is located dorsal to the gut and serves as a harpoon or tentacle for food capture. in some species it is ornamented with barbs. the rhynchocoel is a fluid - filled cavity that extends from the head to nearly two - thirds of the length of the gut in these animals ( figure 28. 20 ). the proboscis may be extended by hydrostatic pressure generated by contraction of muscle of the rhynchocoel and retracted by a retractor muscle attached to the rear wall of the rhynchocoel. figure 28. 20 the anatomy of a nemertean is shown. link to learning watch this video ( https : / / www. openstax. org / l / nemertean ) to see a nemertean attack a polychaete with its proboscis. digestive system the nemerteans, which are primarily predators of annelids and crustaceans, have a well - developed digestive system. a mouth opening that is ventral to the rhynchocoel leads into the foregut, followed by the intestine. the intestine is present in the form of diverticular pouches and ends in a rectum that opens via an anus. gonads are interspersed with the intestinal diverticular pouches and open outward via genital pores. nemerteans are sometimes classified as acoels, but because their closed circulatory system is derived from the coelomic cavity of the embryo, they may be regarded as coelomic. their circulatory system consists of a closed loop formed by a connected pair of lateral blood vessels. some species may also have a dorsal vessel or cross - connecting vessels in addition to lateral ones. although the circulatory fluid contains cells, it is often colorless. however, the blood cells of some species bear hemoglobin as well as other yellow or green pigments. the blood vessels are contractile, although there is usually no regular circulatory pathway, and movement of blood is also facilitated by the contraction of muscles in the body wall

Question #19: When male lions reach sexual maturity, they leave their group in search of a new pride. This can alter the allele frequencies of the population through which of the following mechanisms?

============================================================
	0: natural selection

	1: genetic drift

	2: gene flow

	3: random mating

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Based on a critical analysis of each option, genetic drift is the most likely mechanism through which the allele frequencies of the population can be altered when male lions leave their group in search of a new pride. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. INITIAL SCRUTINY:
- Genetic drift might not be as familiar or commonly discussed as natural selection or gene flow, making it less likely to be chosen at first glance.
- The term 'genetic drift' might not immediately stand out or seem relevant to the scenario, making it a clever distractor.

2. ASSUMPTION ANALYSIS:
- Genetic drift operates on random chance events, which could lead to changes in allele frequencies when a small group of lions establishes a new pride.
- The context of male lions leaving their group introduces a scenario where random events can significantly impact allele frequencies.

3. MISCONCEPTION CHECK:
- Genetic drift is often overlooked in favor of more well-known mechanisms like natural selection.
- It may seem less intuitive compared to natural selection or gene flow, leading to misconceptions about its importance.

4. TECHNICAL PRECISION:
- Genetic drift is a specific mechanism that describes random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events, aligning closely with the scenario described.

5. FINAL VERIFICATION:
- The strongest argument against genetic drift could be the potential influence of gene flow if the male lions interact with other prides, leading to allele exchange.
- To defend genetic drift, one could emphasize the random nature of the events and the lack of selective pressure in this scenario.
- Edge cases might include scenarios where male lions leaving the group do not establish new prides or interact with other prides, limiting the impact of genetic drift.
- Other choices might be designed to exploit common misconceptions or assumptions about more prominent mechanisms like natural selection.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=When male lions leave their group in search of a new pride, they can introduce new alleles into the population through gene flow. Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, leading to changes in allele frequencies. This mechanism can increase genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection, genetic drift, and random mating are other mechanisms that can also affect allele frequencies but are not specifically related to the scenario described.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Genetic drift is the mechanism through which the allele frequencies of a population can be altered due to random sampling effects. In this scenario, when male lions leave their group and join a new pride, they are introducing a random change in allele frequencies within the population. This is a more plausible mechanism compared to natural selection, gene flow, or random mating in this specific context.

( credit a : modification of work by nigel wedge ; credit b : modification of work by u. s. fish and wildlife service ) populations of species share a gene pool : a collection of all the gene variants in the species. again, the basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. when variations occur within a species, they can only pass to the next generation along two main pathways : asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. the change will pass on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. for the changed trait to pass on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait. in other words, sexually - reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. only heritable traits can evolve. therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. in short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring. speciation the biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential interbreeding individuals. there are exceptions to this rule. many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. the presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed. given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation : the formation of two species from one original species. darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration in on the origin of species ( figure 18. 11a ). compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution ( figure 18. 11 )

encountered. the arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code. there are sixteen " blocks " of codons, each specified by the first and second nucleotides of the codons within the block, e. g., the " ac * " block that corresponds to the amino acid threonine ( thr ). some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half, in which the codon ends with u or c, and a purine half, in which the codon ends with a or g. some amino acids get a whole block of four codons, like alanine ( ala ), threonine ( thr ) and proline ( pro ). some get the pyrimidine half of their block, like histidine ( his ) and asparagine ( asn ). others get the purine half of their block, like glutamate ( glu ) and lysine ( lys ). note that some amino acids get a block and a half - block for a total of six codons. the specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called " degeneracy. " degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. for example, aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ), which occupy the ga * block, are both negatively charged. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single - nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. access for free at openstax. org. 15. 1 • the genetic code the genetic code is nearly universal. with a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering
