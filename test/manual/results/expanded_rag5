encountered. the arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code. there are sixteen " blocks " of codons, each specified by the first and second nucleotides of the codons within the block, e. g., the " ac * " block that corresponds to the amino acid threonine ( thr ). some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half, in which the codon ends with u or c, and a purine half, in which the codon ends with a or g. some amino acids get a whole block of four codons, like alanine ( ala ), threonine ( thr ) and proline ( pro ). some get the pyrimidine half of their block, like histidine ( his ) and asparagine ( asn ). others get the purine half of their block, like glutamate ( glu ) and lysine ( lys ). note that some amino acids get a block and a half - block for a total of six codons. the specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called " degeneracy. " degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. for example, aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ), which occupy the ga * block, are both negatively charged. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single - nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. access for free at openstax. org. 15. 1 • the genetic code the genetic code is nearly universal. with a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering

( credit : modification of work by vincent and bella productions ) introduction imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate. you would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions about your location. social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society ; without communication, society would fall apart. as with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. this is true for both a one - celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. in order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message. in multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. the ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine - tune their functions. while the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single - celled organisms communicate with each other. yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells for reproduction. some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. the ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms. the efficient and relatively error - free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it. chapter outline 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors 9. 2 propagation of the signal 9. 3 response to the signal 9. 4 signaling in singlecelled organisms 228 chapter 9 • cell communication 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe four

. parthenogenesis, or “ virgin birth, ” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without egg fertilization. this is a form of asexual reproduction. an example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female. if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. the unfertilized egg is a parthenogenic, or virgin egg. some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults. sexual reproduction requires two cells. when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. the zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. however, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. this idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. therefore, if we replace the egg cell's haploid nucleus with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species ( a donor ), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. scientists can use it for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning. the first cloned animal was dolly, a sheep born in 1996. the reproductive cloning success rate at the time was very low. dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications ( figure 17. 8 ). there is speculation that because the cell dna belongs to an older individual, dna's age may affect a cloned individual's life expectancy. since dolly, scientists have cloned successfully several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats, although these animals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. there have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes. therapeutic cloning produces stem cells in the attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects ( unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism ). still, some have met therapeutic cloning efforts with resistance because of bioethical considerations. access for free at openstax

than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar ecologies. if there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one. many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing. genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. this chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare. humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi, among many other organisms. this diversity is also suffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in densely populated regions such as china, india, and japan. the human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists. it is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or within a given geographic area ( figure 47. 2 ). whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems. the loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. an example of a largely extinct ecosystem in north america is the prairie ecosystem. prairies once spanned central north america from the boreal forest in northern canada down into mexico. they are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl. many of the species survive elsewhere, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive agricultural soils in the united states is now gone. as a consequence, native soils are disappearing or must be maintained and enhanced at great expense. 1373 1374 chapter 47 • conservation biology and biodiversity figure 47. 2 the variety of ecosystems on earth — from ( a ) coral reef to ( b ) prairie — enables a great diversity of species to exist.

effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health. agriculture began after early hunter - gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment. this cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living things on the planet. biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as every other species on the planet is dependent. technology smooths out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem. human health archeological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years. a chinese document from approximately 2800 bc is believed to be the the first written account of herbal remedies, and such references occur throughout the global historical record. contemporary indigenous societies that live close to the land often retain broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication. modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. examples of significant medicines access for free at openstax. org. 47. 2 • the importance of biodiversity to human life derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine ( figure 47. 8 ). many medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. it is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. that number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions. antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria. figure 47. 8 catharanthus roseus, the madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. among other uses, it is a source of vincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas.

middle of the h zone has a vertical line called the m line, at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments. both the z disc and the m line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril. myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the z disc. thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. the tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the m line, whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. the primary component of thin filaments is the actin protein. two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. actin has binding sites for myosin attachment. strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin – myosin interactions when the muscles are at rest. troponin consists of three globular subunits. one subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin, and one subunit binds ca2 + ions. link to learning view this animation showing the organization of muscle fibers. click to view content ( https : / / www. openstax. org / l / skeletal _ muscle ) sliding filament model of contraction for a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. however, thick and thin filaments — the components of sarcomeres — do not shorten. instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length. the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. the mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross - bridges that generate filament movement ( figure 38. 36 ). access for free at openstax. org. 38. 4 • muscle contraction and locomotion figure 38. 36 when ( a ) a sarcomere ( b ) contracts, the z lines move closer together and the i band gets smaller.

##phological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were once thought to be closely related. however, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. these two clades now make up the protostomes. another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely new phylum of worm called acoelomorpha. these acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum platyhelminthes because of their similar “ flatworm ” morphology. however, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. more recent research into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to deuterostomes. the placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data, their true phylogeny will be determined. another example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal kingdom. ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the cnidaria, and the sponges ( porifera ) were placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals. the presence of nerve and muscle cells in both the ctenophores and the cnidaria and their absence in the porifera strengthened this view of the relationships among simple animal forms. however, recent molecular analysis has shown that many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are absent from the ctenophore genome. the muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the mesoglea. the mitochondrial genome of the ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial genomes. these features plus the absence of hox genes from the ctenophores have been used to argue that the ctenophores should be considered basal or as a sister group of the porifera, and that

( credit : modification of work by vincent and bella productions ) introduction imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate. you would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions about your location. social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society ; without communication, society would fall apart. as with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. this is true for both a one - celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. in order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message. in multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. the ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine - tune their functions. while the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single - celled organisms communicate with each other. yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells for reproduction. some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. the ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms. the efficient and relatively error - free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it. chapter outline 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors 9. 2 propagation of the signal 9. 3 response to the signal 9. 4 signaling in singlecelled organisms 228 chapter 9 • cell communication 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe four

thus, adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. the base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds : adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. the two strands are anti - parallel in nature ; that is, the 3'end of one strand faces the 5'end of the other strand. the sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside, like the rungs of a ladder. each base pair is separated from the next base pair by a distance of 0. 34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3. 4 nm. therefore, 10 base pairs are present per turn of the helix. the diameter of the dna double - helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine and the antiparallel orientation of the two dna strands can explain the uniform diameter. the twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves ( figure 14. 7 ). figure 14. 7 dna has ( a ) a double helix structure and ( b ) phosphodiester bonds ; the dotted lines between thymine and adenine and guanine and cytosine represent hydrogen bonds. the ( c ) major and minor grooves are binding sites for dna binding proteins during processes such as transcription ( the copying of rna from dna ) and replication. dna sequencing techniques until the 1990s, the sequencing of dna ( reading the sequence of dna ) was a relatively expensive and long process. using radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. with currently available technology and access for free at openstax. org. 14. 2 • dna structure and sequencing automated machines, the process is cheaper, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. fred sanger developed the sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today ( figure 14. 8 ). link to learning visit this site ( http : / / openstax. org / l / dna _ sequencing ) to watch a video explaining the dna sequence - reading

" degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. for example, aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ), which occupy the ga * block, are both negatively charged. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single - nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. access for free at openstax. org. 15. 1 • the genetic code the genetic code is nearly universal. with a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering

colonize land. actinobacteria are a group of very common gram - positive bacteria that produce branched structures like fungal mycelia, and include species important in decomposition of organic wastes. you will recall that deinococcus is a genus of bacterium that is highly resistant to ionizing radiation. it has a thick peptidoglycan layer in addition to a second external membrane, so it has features of both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria. cyanobacteria are photosynthesizers, and were probably responsible for the production of oxygen on the ancient earth. the timelines of divergence suggest that bacteria ( members of the domain bacteria ) diverged from common ancestral species between 2. 5 and 3. 2 billion years ago, whereas the archaea diverged earlier : between 3. 1 and 4. 1 billion years ago. eukarya later diverged from the archaean line. the work further suggests that stromatolites that formed prior to the advent of cyanobacteria ( about 2. 6 billion years ago ) photosynthesized in an anoxic environment and that because of the modifications of the terrabacteria for land ( resistance to drying and the possession of compounds that protect the organism from excess light ), photosynthesis using oxygen may be closely linked to adaptations to survive on land. 2battistuzzi, fu, feijao, a, and hedges, sb. a genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution : insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land. biomed central : evolutionary biology 4 ( 2004 ) : 44, doi : 10. 1186 / 1471 - 2148 - 4 - 44. access for free at openstax. org. 22. 3 • prokaryotic metabolism 22. 3 prokaryotic metabolism by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • identify the macronutrients needed by prokaryotes, and explain their importance • describe the ways in which prokaryotes get energy and carbon for life processes • describe the roles of prokaryotes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms. in many cases, a prokaryote may be placed into a species clade by its defining metabolic features : can it metabolize lactose? can it grow on

adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life - history patterns the logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of realworld population dynamics. implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. the carrying capacity varies annually : for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. in many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. they engage in interspecific competition : that is, they share the environment with other species competing for the same resources. these factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow. nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. these are grouped into density - dependent factors, in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density - independent factors, which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density. note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset. conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation. density - dependent regulation most density - dependent factors are biological in nature ( biotic ), and include predation, inter - and intraspecific competition, accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. for example, during intra - and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower, reducing their population ’ s rate of growth. in addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source. an example of density - dependent regulation is shown in figure 45. 11 with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal roundworm ( ascaris lumbricoides ), a parasite of humans and other mammals. 3 denser populations of the parasite exhibited lower fecundity : they contained fewer eggs. one possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations ( due to limited resources ) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. this hypothesis was tested and disproved in

##ukaryote evolution scientists believe the ultimate in hgt occurs through genome fusion between different prokaryote species when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic. this occurs when one species is taken inside another species'cytoplasm, which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host. this mechanism is an aspect of the endosymbiont theory, which most biologists accept as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts. however, the role of endosymbiosis in developing the nucleus is more controversial. scientists believe that nuclear and mitochondrial dna have different ( separate ) evolutionary origins, with the mitochondrial dna derived from the bacteria's circular genomes ancient prokaryotic cells engulfed. we can regard mitochondrial dna as the smallest chromosome. interestingly enough, mitochondrial dna is inherited only from the mother. the mitochondrial dna degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other instances when the mitochondria located in the sperm's flagellum fails to enter the egg. within the past decade, james lake of the ucla / nasa astrobiology institute proposed that the genome fusion process is responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells ( figure 20. 14a ). using dna analysis and a new mathematical algorithm, conditioned reconstruction ( cr ), his laboratory proposed that eukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species, one an archaea and the other a bacteria. as mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of archaea ; whereas, others resemble those from bacteria. an endosymbiotic fusion event, such as lake has proposed, would clearly explain this observation. alternatively, this work is new and the cr algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many scientists to resist this hypothesis. lake's more recent work ( figure 20. 14b ) proposes that gram - negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain in that access for free at openstax. org. 20. 3 • perspectives on the phylogenetic tree they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial species. the double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis

##cytes transport food from cells that have ingested food particles to those that do not. in sponges, in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity, all digestion is intracellular. the limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells. all other major body functions in the sponge ( gas exchange, circulation, excretion ) are performed by diffusion between the cells that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. all cell types within the sponge obtain oxygen from water through diffusion. likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. in addition, nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it passes through the sponge. some sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells. it may be a surprise to learn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges, which feed primarily on tiny crustaceans, snaring them through sticky threads or hooked spicules! although there is no specialized nervous system in sponges, there is intercellular communication that can regulate events like contraction of the sponge's body or the activity of the choanocytes. reproduction sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. the typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation ( during this process, a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual ), or budding ( a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony ). an atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules. gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges ( e. g., in the freshwater sponge spongilla ). in gemmules, an inner layer of archeocytes ( amoebocytes ) is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with spicules. in freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature, and then serve

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Option 3 is the correct answer because it accurately describes the reproductive combination that produces hybrids. When members of closely related species reproduce, they can produce hybrids that inherit traits from both parent species. This option may be appealing at first glance because it aligns with the common understanding of hybridization between closely related species. It may also seem plausible because it involves reproduction between similar organisms, which is a common scenario for hybridization. The other options are designed as distractors by including elements of reproduction but not specifically related to hybrid production.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=The correct answer is when members of closely related species reproduce.

parthenogenesis ( or “ virgin beginning ” ). in this case, progeny develop from a gamete, but without fertilization. because of the nutrients stored in eggs, only females produce parthenogenetic offspring. in some insects, unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring. this type of sex determination is called haplodiploidy, since females are diploid ( with both maternal and paternal chromosomes ) and males are haploid ( with only maternal chromosomes ). a few vertebrates, e. g., some fish, turkeys, rattlesnakes, and whiptail lizards, are also capable of parthenogenesis. in the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes, parthenogenetically reproducing females also produce only male offspring, but not because the males are haploid. in birds and rattlesnakes, the female is the heterogametic ( zw ) sex, so the only surviving progeny of post - meiotic parthenogenesis would be zz males. in the whiptail lizards, on the other hand, only female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis. these animals may not be identical to their parent, although they have only maternal chromosomes. however, for animals that are limited in their access to mates, uniparental reproduction can ensure genetic propagation. in animals, the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages, during which primary germ layers ( ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm ) are established and reorganize to form an embryo. during this process, animal tissues begin to specialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology. animal development begins with cleavage, a series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote ( figure 27. 3 ). cleavage differs from somatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller and smaller cells, with no actual cell growth. the cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in this way are called blastomeres. three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure. after further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells, a solid morula is formed, followed by a hollow structure

there is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. when rapidly dividing mammalian cells are grown in a culture ( outside the body under optimal growing conditions ), the length of the cell cycle is about 24 hours. in rapidly dividing human cells with a 24 - hour cell cycle, the g1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the s phase lasts 10 hours, the g2 263 264 chapter 10 • cell reproduction phase lasts about four and one - half hours, and the m phase lasts approximately one - half hour. by comparison, in fertilized eggs ( and early embryos ) of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. this is because the nucleus of the fertilized egg divides many times by mitosis but does not go through cytokinesis until a multinucleate “ zygote ” has been produced, with many nuclei located along the periphery of the cell membrane, thereby shortening the time of the cell division cycle. the timing of events in the cell cycle of both “ invertebrates ” and “ vertebrates ” is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell. regulation of the cell cycle by external events both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process. an event may be as simple as the death of nearby cells or as sweeping as the release of growth - promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone ( hgh or hgh ). a lack of hgh can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much hgh can result in gigantism. crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. in contrast, a factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell : as a cell grows, it becomes physiologically inefficient due to its decreasing surface - tovolume ratio. the solution to this problem is to divide. whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress. regulation at internal checkpoints it is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed

( animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring. ) scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. with such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. reproductive isolation given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be nonviable or infertile. many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations. reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. scientists organize them into two groups : prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. recall that

	2: gene flow

	3: random mating

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The correct answer is genetic drift. When male lions leave their group in search of a new pride, they are causing a change in allele frequencies within the population through a random process (genetic drift) rather than through natural selection, gene flow, or random mating. This choice may be designed as a distractor by including terms like 'allele frequencies' and 'population dynamics' that could lead to confusion with other evolutionary mechanisms.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=When male lions leave their group in search of a new pride, they can introduce new alleles into the new population through gene flow. Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, leading to changes in allele frequencies. This mechanism can increase genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection, genetic drift, and random mating do not directly involve the transfer of genetic material between populations.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Genetic drift is the most suitable mechanism to explain how the departure of male lions can alter allele frequencies in a population. This choice is not as commonly known or intuitive as natural selection or gene flow, making it less likely to be chosen as a distractor. Genetic drift refers to random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events, such as the departure of a few individuals from a population, leading to a shift in genetic diversity.

abundant and active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. oxygen levels similar to today ’ s levels only arose within the last 700 million years. recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they seemed to have evolved and diversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing. also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with mitochondria. these organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be somewhat worm - shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. some early observers suggested that they might be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities. endosymbiotic theory as cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing atp using aerobic respiration, in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor. in the 1960s, american biologist lynn margulis of boston university developed the endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce atp. in 1967, margulis introduced new data to support her work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence. although margulis ’ s work initially was met with resistance, this basic component of this once - revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players involved. while the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy - harvesting processes appear to have had their origins in bacteria, our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear to be more closely related to those found in the archaea. much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred ; this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology. for instance, it is not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria occurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common ancestor

plant coevolution is found in bracken fern ( pteridium aquinilum ), whose subspecies are found throughout the world. bracken ferns produce a number of “ secondary plant compounds ” in their adult fronds that serve as defensive compounds against nonadapted insect attack ( these compounds include cyanogenic glucosides, tannins, and phenolics ). however, during the “ fiddlehead ” or crozier stage, bracken secretes nutritious sugary and proteinaceous compounds from special “ nectaries ” that attract ants and even species of jumping spiders, all of which defend the plant ’ s croziers until they are fully unfolded. these opportunistic groups of protective arthropods greatly reduce the damage that otherwise would occur during the early stages of growth. access for free at openstax. org. 26. 4 • the role of seed plants animals and plants : pollination flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. grasses are a successful group of flowering plants that are wind pollinated. they produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over large distances by the wind. some large trees such as oaks, maples, and birches are also wind pollinated. link to learning explore this website ( http : / / openstax. org / l / pollinators2 ) for additional information on pollinators. more than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination ( technically the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma ). consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators. with over 200, 000 different plants dependent on animal pollination, the plant needs to advertise to its pollinators with some specificity. the specificity of specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising. it is possible, for example, to determine the general type of pollinators favored by a plant by observing the flower ’ s physical characteristics. many bird or insect - pollinated flowers secrete nectar, which is a sugary liquid. they also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects. many butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light, and flowers that attract these pollinators usually display a pattern of ultraviolet reflectance that helps them
