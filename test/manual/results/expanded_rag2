encountered. the arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code. there are sixteen " blocks " of codons, each specified by the first and second nucleotides of the codons within the block, e. g., the " ac * " block that corresponds to the amino acid threonine ( thr ). some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half, in which the codon ends with u or c, and a purine half, in which the codon ends with a or g. some amino acids get a whole block of four codons, like alanine ( ala ), threonine ( thr ) and proline ( pro ). some get the pyrimidine half of their block, like histidine ( his ) and asparagine ( asn ). others get the purine half of their block, like glutamate ( glu ) and lysine ( lys ). note that some amino acids get a block and a half - block for a total of six codons. the specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called " degeneracy. " degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. for example, aspartate ( asp ) and glutamate ( glu ), which occupy the ga * block, are both negatively charged. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single - nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. access for free at openstax. org. 15. 1 • the genetic code the genetic code is nearly universal. with a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering

( credit : modification of work by vincent and bella productions ) introduction imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate. you would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions about your location. social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society ; without communication, society would fall apart. as with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. this is true for both a one - celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. in order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message. in multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. the ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine - tune their functions. while the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single - celled organisms communicate with each other. yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells for reproduction. some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. the ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms. the efficient and relatively error - free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it. chapter outline 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors 9. 2 propagation of the signal 9. 3 response to the signal 9. 4 signaling in singlecelled organisms 228 chapter 9 • cell communication 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe four

. parthenogenesis, or “ virgin birth, ” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without egg fertilization. this is a form of asexual reproduction. an example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female. if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. the unfertilized egg is a parthenogenic, or virgin egg. some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults. sexual reproduction requires two cells. when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. the zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. however, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. this idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. therefore, if we replace the egg cell's haploid nucleus with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species ( a donor ), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. scientists can use it for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning. the first cloned animal was dolly, a sheep born in 1996. the reproductive cloning success rate at the time was very low. dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications ( figure 17. 8 ). there is speculation that because the cell dna belongs to an older individual, dna's age may affect a cloned individual's life expectancy. since dolly, scientists have cloned successfully several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats, although these animals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. there have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes. therapeutic cloning produces stem cells in the attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects ( unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism ). still, some have met therapeutic cloning efforts with resistance because of bioethical considerations. access for free at openstax

than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar ecologies. if there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one. many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing. genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. this chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare. humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi, among many other organisms. this diversity is also suffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in densely populated regions such as china, india, and japan. the human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists. it is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or within a given geographic area ( figure 47. 2 ). whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems. the loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. an example of a largely extinct ecosystem in north america is the prairie ecosystem. prairies once spanned central north america from the boreal forest in northern canada down into mexico. they are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl. many of the species survive elsewhere, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive agricultural soils in the united states is now gone. as a consequence, native soils are disappearing or must be maintained and enhanced at great expense. 1373 1374 chapter 47 • conservation biology and biodiversity figure 47. 2 the variety of ecosystems on earth — from ( a ) coral reef to ( b ) prairie — enables a great diversity of species to exist.

effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health. agriculture began after early hunter - gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment. this cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living things on the planet. biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as every other species on the planet is dependent. technology smooths out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem. human health archeological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years. a chinese document from approximately 2800 bc is believed to be the the first written account of herbal remedies, and such references occur throughout the global historical record. contemporary indigenous societies that live close to the land often retain broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication. modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. examples of significant medicines access for free at openstax. org. 47. 2 • the importance of biodiversity to human life derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine ( figure 47. 8 ). many medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. it is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. that number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions. antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria. figure 47. 8 catharanthus roseus, the madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. among other uses, it is a source of vincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas.

Question #5: Individual genetic maps in a given species are:

============================================================
	0: genetically similar

	1: genetically identical

	2: genetically dissimilar

	3: not useful in species analysis

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Genetically identical is the most accurate description of individual genetic maps in a given species. This choice is appealing because it simplifies the concept of genetic maps and aligns with the idea of species having a consistent genetic makeup. The term 'genetically identical' may create a false sense of correctness by implying absolute uniformity, which may not be the case due to genetic variations. However, in the context of genetic maps within a species, it is a valid and precise description. Other choices are less accurate and do not align with the nature of genetic maps in a species.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=1, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Individual genetic maps in a given species are genetically similar. Genetic maps represent the arrangement of genes on a chromosome and are based on genetic markers. In a species, individuals share a high degree of genetic similarity due to their common ancestry and species-specific genetic characteristics. While there may be variations among individuals, the overall genetic maps are similar within a species.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.8, reasoning=Genetically identical is the correct choice for this question. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. INITIAL SCRUTINY:
- Appealing at first glance: The term 'genetically identical' is straightforward and clear.
- Familiar terms: It uses familiar genetic terminology that may seem correct.
- Clever distractor: It may seem too simple, leading to potential oversight.

2. ASSUMPTION ANALYSIS:
- Unstated premises: Assuming genetic maps refer to the same individual in the species.
- Context assumptions: Assuming a standard genetic mapping scenario.
- Change under circumstances: Would change if referring to different individuals.

3. MISCONCEPTION CHECK:
- Common misconception: Assuming all individuals in a species have the same genetic map.
- Tempting information: Appeals to the idea of uniformity in genetic maps.
- Confusing concepts: Mixing up individual genetic variation with overall species diversity.

4. TECHNICAL PRECISION:
- Scope: The term 'genetically identical' is precise and directly addresses the question.
- Missing qualifications: None, as the question is specific.
- Technically true: Fully answers the question without ambiguity.
- Wording: Clear and unambiguous.

5. FINAL VERIFICATION:
- Strongest argument against: Variation exists within individuals of a species.
- Defense against other options: Genetic similarity does not imply identity.
- Edge cases: Mutations, genetic recombination, and environmental factors can lead to differences.
- Deliberate design: Other choices play on the misconception of uniformity in genetic maps.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=1, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Based on the information provided in the context, individual genetic maps in a given species are genetically identical. The context discusses genetic linkage, recombination frequency, and the arrangement of genes on chromosomes, which all point towards the fact that genetic maps within a species are identical. This consistency in genetic maps is crucial for understanding inheritance patterns and genetic relationships within a species.
, prompt type=PromptType.PLAIN, answer_index=1, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Individual genetic maps in a given species are genetically similar because individuals within a species share a common gene pool and genetic variation is usually limited within a species.

( credit : modification of work by vincent and bella productions ) introduction imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate. you would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions about your location. social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society ; without communication, society would fall apart. as with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. this is true for both a one - celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. in order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message. in multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. the ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine - tune their functions. while the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single - celled organisms communicate with each other. yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells for reproduction. some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. the ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms. the efficient and relatively error - free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it. chapter outline 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors 9. 2 propagation of the signal 9. 3 response to the signal 9. 4 signaling in singlecelled organisms 228 chapter 9 • cell communication 9. 1 signaling molecules and cellular receptors by the end of this section, you will be able to do the following : • describe four

( credit : mari tefre, svalbard global seed vault ) the svalbard global seed vault is located on spitsbergen island in norway, which has an arctic climate. why might an arctic climate be good for seed storage? crop success is largely dependent on the quality of the soil. although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using controversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient cycles — breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. these organisms also maintain soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. if farmers had to maintain arable soil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now. these kinds of processes are called ecosystem services. they occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable air. plant pollination is another key ecosystem service, provided by various species of bees, other insects, and birds. one estimate indicates that honey bee pollination provides the united states a $ 1. 6 billion annual benefit. honey bee populations in north america have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, whose cause is unclear. ( evidence suggests the possible culprits may be the invasive varroa mite coupled with the nosema gut parasite and acute paralysis virus. ) loss of these species would render it very difficult, if not impossible, to grow any of the 150 united states crops requiring pollination, including grapes, oranges, lemons, peppers, most brassica ( broccoli and cauliflower ), and many berries, melons, and nuts. finally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. pesticides control these competitors ; however, pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time

##cytes transport food from cells that have ingested food particles to those that do not. in sponges, in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity, all digestion is intracellular. the limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells. all other major body functions in the sponge ( gas exchange, circulation, excretion ) are performed by diffusion between the cells that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. all cell types within the sponge obtain oxygen from water through diffusion. likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. in addition, nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it passes through the sponge. some sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells. it may be a surprise to learn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges, which feed primarily on tiny crustaceans, snaring them through sticky threads or hooked spicules! although there is no specialized nervous system in sponges, there is intercellular communication that can regulate events like contraction of the sponge's body or the activity of the choanocytes. reproduction sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. the typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation ( during this process, a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual ), or budding ( a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony ). an atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules. gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges ( e. g., in the freshwater sponge spongilla ). in gemmules, an inner layer of archeocytes ( amoebocytes ) is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with spicules. in freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature, and then serve

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Option 3 is the correct answer because it accurately describes the production of hybrids through the reproduction of members of closely related species. This option aligns with the biological definition of hybridization, where individuals of different but closely related species mate and produce offspring with a mix of traits. While other options may seem plausible at first glance, only option 3 directly addresses the concept of hybridization in the context of reproductive combinations.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=Hybrids are produced when members of closely related species reproduce.

, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Option 3 is the correct answer because it accurately describes the production of hybrids when members of closely related species reproduce. This option challenges common assumptions by highlighting the importance of genetic similarity in hybridization, which is a key factor in producing viable offspring. While other options may seem plausible at first glance, they do not accurately reflect the process of hybridization.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The context mentions that in the section about characteristics and traits evolution, multiple alleles confer drug resistance in the malaria parasite. This information about genetic traits and variations among closely related species supports the idea that hybrids are produced when members of closely related species reproduce.

parthenogenesis ( or “ virgin beginning ” ). in this case, progeny develop from a gamete, but without fertilization. because of the nutrients stored in eggs, only females produce parthenogenetic offspring. in some insects, unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring. this type of sex determination is called haplodiploidy, since females are diploid ( with both maternal and paternal chromosomes ) and males are haploid ( with only maternal chromosomes ). a few vertebrates, e. g., some fish, turkeys, rattlesnakes, and whiptail lizards, are also capable of parthenogenesis. in the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes, parthenogenetically reproducing females also produce only male offspring, but not because the males are haploid. in birds and rattlesnakes, the female is the heterogametic ( zw ) sex, so the only surviving progeny of post - meiotic parthenogenesis would be zz males. in the whiptail lizards, on the other hand, only female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis. these animals may not be identical to their parent, although they have only maternal chromosomes. however, for animals that are limited in their access to mates, uniparental reproduction can ensure genetic propagation. in animals, the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages, during which primary germ layers ( ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm ) are established and reorganize to form an embryo. during this process, animal tissues begin to specialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology. animal development begins with cleavage, a series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote ( figure 27. 3 ). cleavage differs from somatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller and smaller cells, with no actual cell growth. the cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in this way are called blastomeres. three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure. after further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells, a solid morula is formed, followed by a hollow structure

there is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. when rapidly dividing mammalian cells are grown in a culture ( outside the body under optimal growing conditions ), the length of the cell cycle is about 24 hours. in rapidly dividing human cells with a 24 - hour cell cycle, the g1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the s phase lasts 10 hours, the g2 263 264 chapter 10 • cell reproduction phase lasts about four and one - half hours, and the m phase lasts approximately one - half hour. by comparison, in fertilized eggs ( and early embryos ) of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. this is because the nucleus of the fertilized egg divides many times by mitosis but does not go through cytokinesis until a multinucleate “ zygote ” has been produced, with many nuclei located along the periphery of the cell membrane, thereby shortening the time of the cell division cycle. the timing of events in the cell cycle of both “ invertebrates ” and “ vertebrates ” is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell. regulation of the cell cycle by external events both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process. an event may be as simple as the death of nearby cells or as sweeping as the release of growth - promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone ( hgh or hgh ). a lack of hgh can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much hgh can result in gigantism. crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. in contrast, a factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell : as a cell grows, it becomes physiologically inefficient due to its decreasing surface - tovolume ratio. the solution to this problem is to divide. whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress. regulation at internal checkpoints it is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed

( animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring. ) scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. with such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. reproductive isolation given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be nonviable or infertile. many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations. reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. scientists organize them into two groups : prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. recall that

( credit a : james d. gathany ; credit b : ute frevert ; false color by margaret shear ; scale - bar data from matt russell ) in southeast asia, africa, and south america, p. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti - malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine. p. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug - resistant mutant alleles of the dhps gene. varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. being haploid, p. falciparum needs only one drug - resistant allele to express this trait. in southeast asia, different sulfadoxine - resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different geographic regions. this is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug - resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other

Question #19: When male lions reach sexual maturity, they leave their group in search of a new pride. This can alter the allele frequencies of the population through which of the following mechanisms?

============================================================
	0: natural selection

	1: genetic drift

	2: gene flow

	3: random mating

All results: 
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=I choose option 2, genetic drift, as the mechanism that can alter the allele frequencies of the population when male lions leave their group in search of a new pride. Here's the breakdown:

1. INITIAL SCRUTINY:
- Genetic drift is a term commonly associated with changes in allele frequencies in small populations due to random chance events. The idea of male lions leaving their group can be seen as a random event that can influence allele frequencies.
- Genetic drift might be designed as a clever distractor because it is not directly related to the concept of male lions leaving their group, but the randomness of the event can lead to genetic changes.

2. ASSUMPTION ANALYSIS:
- We might be assuming that the departure of male lions is a random event that can influence allele frequencies in the population.
- The answer might change if the departure of male lions was not a random process or if there were other factors at play.

3. MISCONCEPTION CHECK:
- Genetic drift is a common concept in population genetics, but its application to the behavior of male lions might not be immediately obvious.
- It might be tempting to choose natural selection or gene flow, but genetic drift better fits the scenario of random changes in allele frequencies.

4. TECHNICAL PRECISION:
- Genetic drift is a specific mechanism that involves random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events in small populations.
- The answer is technically true in the context of allele frequency changes in a population.

5. FINAL VERIFICATION:
- The strongest argument against genetic drift could be that the departure of male lions is not entirely random and may be influenced by factors like competition or resource availability.
- I would defend this answer by emphasizing the random nature of genetic drift and how it can apply to scenarios beyond traditional population genetics.
- Edge cases might include situations where the departure of male lions is not a significant factor in allele frequency changes.
- Other choices might be designed to look correct by using more familiar concepts like natural selection or gene flow, which may not directly apply to this scenario.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=When male lions leave their group and join a new pride, they can introduce new alleles into the population through gene flow. Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, leading to changes in allele frequencies. This mechanism can increase genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection, genetic drift, and random mating are other mechanisms that can also affect allele frequencies but are not directly related to the scenario described.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Genetic drift is the mechanism through which male lions leaving their group can alter the allele frequencies of the population. This choice is the most accurate because genetic drift refers to random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events, such as the departure of individuals from a population. In this case, the departure of male lions can lead to a random shift in allele frequencies within the population.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Based on the provided context, the mechanism that can alter the allele frequencies of the population when male lions leave their group in search of a new pride is gene flow. Gene flow refers to the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, which can introduce new alleles and change allele frequencies. In the context, the movement of male lions to a new pride can introduce new genetic variations to the population, impacting allele frequencies.
, prompt type=PromptType.PLAIN, answer_index=3, confidence=0.9, reasoning=When male lions leave their group in search of a new pride, they can introduce new alleles into the new pride through gene flow. This can alter the allele frequencies in the population by increasing genetic diversity.

abundant and active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. oxygen levels similar to today ’ s levels only arose within the last 700 million years. recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they seemed to have evolved and diversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing. also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with mitochondria. these organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be somewhat worm - shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. some early observers suggested that they might be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities. endosymbiotic theory as cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing atp using aerobic respiration, in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor. in the 1960s, american biologist lynn margulis of boston university developed the endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce atp. in 1967, margulis introduced new data to support her work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence. although margulis ’ s work initially was met with resistance, this basic component of this once - revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players involved. while the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy - harvesting processes appear to have had their origins in bacteria, our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear to be more closely related to those found in the archaea. much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred ; this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology. for instance, it is not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria occurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common ancestor
