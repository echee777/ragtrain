Question: Insulin produced by molecular cloning:

All results:
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=1, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Insulin produced by molecular cloning is a recombinant protein. This choice is the correct answer because insulin produced by molecular cloning involves inserting the human insulin gene into a host organism, such as bacteria or yeast, to produce insulin.

All results:
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=1, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The longer distance between divided groups increases the likelihood of allopatric speciation taking place more quickly because it reduces the chances of gene flow between the populations, leading to genetic isolation and divergence. This physical barrier plays a crucial role in driving speciation in allopatric conditions.

, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=3, confidence=0.95, reasoning=In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies remain constant over generations in the absence of evolutionary influences such as natural selection. Option 4, a population undergoing natural selection, is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because natural selection leads to changes in allele frequencies based on the fitness of individuals, which contradicts the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=3, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The population undergoing natural selection is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because natural selection causes changes in allele frequencies over time, which is a violation of the conditions required for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary forces like natural selection.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=3, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The context provided discusses the concept of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which states that allele frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that leads to changes in allele frequencies, so a population undergoing natural selection would not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Question: When male lions reach sexual maturity, they leave their group in search of a new pride. This can alter the allele frequencies of the population through which of the following mechanisms?

All results:
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Gene flow is the mechanism through which the movement of individuals between populations can alter allele frequencies. In the case of male lions leaving their group to join a new pride, this movement introduces new alleles to the new population, potentially changing the allele frequencies. While other mechanisms like natural selection and genetic drift can also impact allele frequencies, gene flow specifically addresses the movement of individuals between populations, making it the most relevant choice in this context.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=2, confidence=0.95, reasoning=When male lions leave their group in search of a new pride, they can introduce new alleles into the population through gene flow. Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, leading to changes in allele frequencies. This mechanism can increase genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection, genetic drift, and random mating do not directly involve the transfer of genetic material between populations.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Gene flow is the mechanism through which male lions leaving their group and joining a new pride can alter allele frequencies in the population. This is because the movement of individuals between populations can introduce new alleles and change the genetic composition of the population.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=2, confidence=0.9, reasoning=The mechanism through which male lions leaving their group in search of a new pride can alter the allele frequencies of the population is gene flow. Gene flow refers to the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, leading to a mixing of gene pools. In this case, when male lions migrate and join a new pride, they bring their genetic material with them, introducing new alleles to the population and potentially changing the allele frequencies. This aligns with the concept of gene flow described in the context provided.

Question: What is assortative mating?

All results:
[prompt type=PromptType.COT, answer_index=0, confidence=0.8, reasoning=Assortative mating is when individuals mate with those who are similar to themselves, based on certain characteristics such as physical appearance, intelligence, or socio-economic status. This choice aligns with the commonly accepted definition of assortative mating in the field of biology and sociology.
, prompt type=PromptType.FEW_SHOT, answer_index=0, confidence=0.95, reasoning=Assortative mating is when individuals mate with those who are similar to themselves in certain characteristics, such as phenotype or genotype. This can lead to the reinforcement of certain traits within a population and is a key concept in evolutionary biology and population genetics. The other options do not accurately describe assortative mating.
, prompt type=PromptType.CONTRARIAN, answer_index=0, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Assortative mating is when individuals mate with those who are similar to themselves, based on characteristics like physical appearance, intelligence, or socioeconomic status. This choice aligns with the commonly accepted definition of assortative mating and is supported by research in the field of evolutionary biology and genetics.
, prompt type=PromptType.RAG, answer_index=0, confidence=0.9, reasoning=Assortative mating is when individuals mate with those who are similar to themselves. This concept aligns with the idea of individuals choosing mates based on similarities, which is supported by the context discussing the genetic basis of traits and the passing on of genetic variations through reproduction.
