Let's solve this multiple choice question. Here are some examples of how to approach similar questions:

EXAMPLE 1:
Question: What is the primary reason for the seasons on Earth?
1. The Earth's distance from the Sun changes throughout the year
2. The Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane
3. The Sun's energy output varies seasonally
4. The Earth's rotation speed changes during the year

Analysis:
- First, identify the key concept: causes of seasonal changes
- Consider what we know about Earth's orbital mechanics
- Examine each option's scientific accuracy:
  1. Common misconception - Earth's orbit is nearly circular
  2. Correct - 23.5Â° tilt causes varying solar exposure
  3. Solar output is relatively constant
  4. Rotation speed remains stable

{
    "answer": "The Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "The Earth's axial tilt means different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year, causing seasonal changes. Other options are either incorrect or irrelevant."
}

EXAMPLE 2:
Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between supply and demand in a market economy?
1. When supply increases, price always decreases
2. When demand decreases, quantity always increases
3. As price rises, demand generally decreases
4. As supply rises, demand automatically rises

Analysis:
- Identify core economic principles at play
- Consider the relationship between variables
- Check for absolute statements vs general trends
- Examine each option's economic logic:
  1. Too absolute - other factors may affect price
  2. Incorrect relationship between variables
  3. Reflects the general demand curve principle
  4. Confuses independent variables

{
    "answer": "As price rises, demand generally decreases",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "This answer correctly describes the general principle of the demand curve without making absolute claims. It acknowledges the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded while avoiding oversimplification."
}

NOW LET'S SOLVE YOUR QUESTION:

QUESTION:

ANSWER CHOICES:
{formatted_choices}

Please analyze this question using the same systematic approach shown in the examples. Provide your answer in the same JSON format:
{
    "answer": "The complete text of your chosen answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)",
    "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of your analysis and why this answer is correct"
}

Remember to:
- Identify the core concept being tested
- Consider relationships between key variables
- Check for common misconceptions
- Avoid absolute statements unless warranted
- Verify the logical consistency of your reasoning
